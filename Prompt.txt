Create a 3D endless runner-style game using Three.js (version 0.164.1) in a single HTML file with modular JavaScript. The game features a player-controlled car navigating a road with mobile-friendly touch controls, collectible points, an enemy car, and a dynamic urban environment. Below is the detailed specification for the implementation:

General Requirements:



Use Three.js with ES modules, loaded via import maps from unpkg.com. Include GLTFLoader and DRACOLoader for 3D model loading.

Ensure the game is responsive and optimized for mobile devices, with touch controls and prevention of default browser behaviors (e.g., pull-to-refresh, text selection).

Optimize for smooth rendering with antialiasing, shadow mapping, and fog to limit draw distance.

Load a car model (ferrari.glb) from https://threejs.org/examples/models/gltf/ferrari.glb using Draco compression for efficient loading.

HTML Structure:



Create an HTML5 document with UTF-8 charset and a responsive viewport meta tag (width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no).

Include a for the Three.js canvas.

Add a that displays "Loading..." and fades out when assets are loaded or shows errors if loading fails.

Include UI elements: for displaying the score (Score: 0).

for showing "GAME OVER!" when the player collides with the enemy car.

Add two circular buttons ( and ) with Unicode arrows (◀ and ▶) for left and right movement.

CSS Styling:



Body: Set margin: 0, overflow: hidden, background-color: #a0d7e6 (light sky blue), font-family: sans-serif, and prevent default touch behaviors (overscroll-behavior: none, touch-action: none).

Canvas: Set display: block to avoid spacing issues.

Loading Screen: Style as a full-screen overlay with centered text, fading out when hidden (opacity: 0, pointer-events: none).

UI Container: Position at top-left (10px, 10px), with white text, black shadow, and z-index: 50.

Game Over: Center on screen, use bright red text (#ff4444), large font (4em), bold, with shadow, initially hidden (display: none), z-index: 101.

Control Buttons:Position at bottom (20px), circular (border-radius: 50%), semi-transparent white background (rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.3)), dark border, large arrow (2.5em).

Left button at left: 20px, right button at right: 20px.

Add :active state with increased opacity (rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5)).

Prevent text selection and tap highlights.

JavaScript Implementation:

Core Setup:

Import THREE, GLTFLoader, and DRACOLoader via import maps.

Create a THREE.Scene with a light sky blue background (0xa0d7e6) and fog (near: roadLength * 0.4, far: roadLength * 0.9).

Use a PerspectiveCamera (FOV 75, aspect ratio from window, near 0.1, far 1000).

Use a WebGLRenderer with antialiasing, soft shadow mapping (PCFSoftShadowMap), and ACES filmic tone mapping. Append to #container.

Add an ambient light (white, intensity 0.6) and a directional light (white, intensity 1.5, casting shadows with a 2048x2048 shadow map).

Game Environment:



Ground: Create a large plane (roadLength * 1.5 wide, roadLength long) with a green material (0x55aa55), rotated flat, slightly below road (y: -0.05), receiving shadows.

Road: Create a plane (roadWidth: 10, roadLength: 200) with a gray material (0x555555), rotated flat (y: 0.0), receiving shadows.

Road Lines: Add white dashed lines (width: 0.3, length: 4, gap: 4) along the road, receiving shadows, recycled when they move off-screen.

Kerbs: Create left and right kerbs (width: 0.3, height: 0.2, length: roadLength) with a red-white striped canvas texture, casting and receiving shadows.

Buildings: Generate numBuildings (based on roadLength / buildingSpacing) on both sides of the road. Each building is a box with random dimensions (width/depth: 4-12, height: 10-40), random colors, and positioned with spacing (buildingSpacing: 15). Recycle when off-screen.

Street Lights: Generate numLights (based on roadLength / lightSpacing) on both sides. Each light has a pole (cylinder, height 6, radius 0.1), an arm (box, length 1), and a glowing sphere (radius 0.2, yellow emissive). Recycle when off-screen.

Traffic Lights: Place one pair at z: roadLength * 0.4, with a pole (height 5, radius 0.15), housing (box, 0.5x1.2x0.3), and three lights (red, yellow, green spheres). Recycle when off-screen.

Game Objects:



Player Car:Load ferrari.glb with GLTFLoader and DRACOLoader (decoder path: https://www.gstatic.com/draco/versioned/decoders/1.5.7/).

Scale to 0.8, rotate to face forward (y: Math.PI), position at (0, carBaseY, 0) where carBaseY is calculated from the model’s bounding box.

Enable shadows for all meshes.

Fallback to a red box (2x1x4) if loading fails, with carBaseY: 0.51.

Enemy Car: Clone the player car, color it blue (0x0000ff), position at a random lane (x: ±roadWidth/4, z: roadLength * 0.7). Moves at enemyCarSpeed: 0.4. Recycle when off-screen.

Points: Create 15 collectible spheres (radius 0.3, yellow, emissive), randomly placed within road bounds. Each awards 10 points when collected. Recycle when off-screen.

Game Mechanics:



Camera: Position at (0, carBaseY + 3, -7), smoothly follow the car’s x-position (lerp factor 0.1), look at (car.x, carBaseY + 1, car.z + 5).

Movement:Scenery (road lines, buildings, kerbs, lights) moves backward at driveSpeed: 0.5, recycling when z < -roadLength / 2.

Player car moves left/right (carMoveSpeed: 0.15) within road bounds (±(roadWidth/2 - kerbWidth - carHalfWidth)).

Enemy car moves independently at enemyCarSpeed.

Controls:Keyboard: Left arrow or ‘A’ for left movement, right arrow or ‘D’ for right. Set moveLeft/moveRight booleans on keydown/keyup.

Touch: Left/right buttons trigger moveLeft/moveRight on touchstart/touchend/touchcancel, with preventDefault() to avoid browser behaviors.

Collisions:Use THREE.Box3 for player, enemy, and points.

Collecting a point hides it, adds 10 to score, and updates the score display.

Collision with the enemy car sets isGameOver: true, shows the game-over text, and stops updates.

Score: Display in #score as Score: ${score}. Update on point collection.

Loading and Error Handling:



Use THREE.LoadingManager to track loading progress:onLoad: Fade out loading screen after 0.5s.

onProgress: Update loading screen with percentage (Loading ${progress}%...).

onError: Display error message and keep loading screen visible.

Handle car model loading errors with a fallback box and error message.

Animation Loop:



Use requestAnimationFrame for continuous updates.

Stop updates if isGameOver is true.

Update scenery, points, enemy car, player movement, camera, and collisions each frame.

Render the scene with renderer.render.

Additional Features:



Resize Handling: Update camera aspect and renderer size on window resize.

Optimization: Use fog, efficient shadow settings, and recycle objects to maintain performance.

Mobile Optimization: Prevent scaling, scrolling, and touch highlights for a smooth mobile experience.

This specification ensures a complete, mobile-friendly 3D car game with clear visual and gameplay elements, optimized for performance and user interaction.
